# checkbox_xlsx.py — turn boolean cells into native Excel checkboxes.
# Usage: imported by test-admin; not run directly.
#
# A VERBATIM COPY of ~/3work/advising-scripts/checkbox_xlsx.py, where it was
# written and verified for the advising tracker (tracker_writer.py is its caller
# there, and the comments below still speak of that tracker). It came here by way
# of MATH 1003's own machinery, and is in the shared machinery now because
# test-admin is. Copied rather than shared with the advising repo because the
# two have nothing else in common. If one copy is
# fixed, fix the other; everything below this paragraph should stay identical.
# ONE DIFFERENCE so far: the <xf> count in _split_cell_xfs, fixed here because
# this caller converts two sheets and the original's count broke on the second.
# The advising copy has the same latent bug but converts only one sheet.
#
# Excel 365 renders a TRUE/FALSE cell as a tickable checkbox when its CELL
# FORMAT carries a "FeaturePropertyBag" extension. openpyxl cannot write that,
# so this post-processes the saved .xlsx: it reopens the archive, injects four
# pieces, and writes it back. Only stdlib zipfile is needed.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY POST-PROCESSING, AND WHY NOT A TEMPLATE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# openpyxl 3.1.5 cannot be coaxed into this, and loading a hand-built template
# does not work either — it fails three separate ways:
#
#   * save() rebuilds the archive from the object model, so an unknown part
#     like xl/featurePropertyBag/ is simply dropped;
#   * keep_vba=True does not rescue it. Its ARC_VBA regex matches only
#     xl/vba, vmlDrawing, ctrlProps, customUI, activeX and media/*.emf, and
#     packaging/manifest.py further restricts carried-over content types to
#     (ACTIVEX, CTRL, VBA);
#   * styles/cell_style.py declares CellStyle.extLst and accepts it in
#     __init__ — then never assigns it, and leaves it out of __elements__ and
#     __attrs__, so it is never serialised. descriptors/excel.py's Extension
#     holds only a `uri` anyway, so the child element cannot be represented.
#
# XlsxWriter implements this feature properly, but it is write-only: adopting
# it would mean rewriting the whole generator — conditional formatting, data
# validation, comments, tables, the hidden sheet — for a cosmetic change to
# two columns.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE FOUR PIECES
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   1. a new part, xl/featurePropertyBag/featurePropertyBag.xml, declaring a
#      Checkbox bag and the chain of bags that maps a cell format to it;
#   2. a content-type override for that part;
#   3. a workbook relationship pointing at it;
#   4. an <extLst> inside the <xf> cell formats that should render as
#      checkboxes, referencing bag 0 of the mapped list.
#
# The CELL is untouched: it stays an ordinary boolean. That is the whole
# reason this degrades gracefully — Office 2019 and LibreOffice ignore the
# extension and show TRUE/FALSE, which is still correct and still readable by
# tracker_reader.
#
# All four were VERIFIED against a workbook Excel itself wrote — a scratch
# file with one checkbox in it — not merely built from the documentation. The
# bag XML, the content type and the relationship came back byte-identical.
# Excel's own file had the extension on the default cell format, so it never
# showed whether <extLst> may follow <alignment>; ours does, and Excel accepts
# it. If this part ever needs changing, make another such file and diff again
# rather than reasoning about the spec.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE TRAP: CLONE THE <xf>, NEVER MUTATE IT
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# openpyxl DEDUPES cell formats. In the tracker the gpa1/gpa2 cells share one
# <xf> with Term, Course, CH, Gr., Pass and Ovr. — every cell that got
# BODY_FONT plus centred alignment. Adding the extension to that <xf> in place
# would turn all six of those columns into checkboxes, and the generated XML
# would look perfectly reasonable while doing it.
#
# So each distinct format in use by a target cell is CLONED to the end of
# <cellXfs> with the extension attached, and only the target cells are
# repointed at the clone. Nothing else in the workbook changes appearance.
#
# Element order matters to Excel: <extLst> must be the LAST child of <xf>,
# after <alignment> and <protection>. Get it wrong, or collide an rId, or
# declare a content type without its part, and Excel offers to "repair" the
# file — which silently discards things.
